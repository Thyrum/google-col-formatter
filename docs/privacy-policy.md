This privacy policy ("policy") will help you understand how the COL Table
Formatter add-on ("the add-on", "COL Formatter" or "we/us") uses and protects
the data you provide us when you visit and use [this website]({{ '/' |
relative_url }}) or use the COL Formatter add-on.

## Core Privacy Commitment

The privacy policy is simple: no personal data shared with us will be given to
any third party, under any circumstances. Your data will also never be used by
us for any purpose without specific permission.

COL Formatter engages in no ad targeting, data mining, or other activities that
may compromise your privacy, and we do not affiliate ourselves with any third
parties that do so.

## Google User Data Access

The COL Formatter add-on accesses only the minimum Google user data required to
provide its core functionality. Specifically, the add-on may:

- View and manage documents that the add-on has been installed in.
- Display and run third-party web content in prompts and sidebars inside Google docs.

We do not access your Google Drive, Gmail, or any other personal Google user
data outside the scope of these permissions.

## Use of Google User Data

The data accessed is used solely to enable the core functionality of the COL
Formatter add-on, including:

- Reading the structure and content of the Google Docs file in which the add-on
  is used, so chord-over-lyrics music can be formatted in tables.
- Applying formatting changes directly to the document upon user request.

No data is stored, transmitted to external servers, or shared with third
parties.

## Data Protection

Although COL Formatter does not collect or store any personal or document data
on external servers, we apply the following data protection mechanisms:

- All operations on documents are performed within the context of the Google Docs
  environment, using Google Apps Script, which adheres to Googleâ€™s security
  standards.
- No document content or metadata is sent to or stored on any third-party
  servers.
- All permissions are limited to the installed document only, with no broader
  access to your Google account.

## Data Retention and Deletion

COL Formatter does not store any Google user data externally. As a result:

- There is no retention of user data beyond the runtime session in which the
  add-on is being used.
- Users retain full control over their documents and data at all times.

If any future version of the add-on introduces optional features that require
data storage (e.g., storing user preferences for formatting), this will
be clearly disclosed, and users will be given the option to opt-in.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we do, the updated
policy will be posted on [this website]({{ '/' | relative_url }}), and changes
will take effect immediately upon publication.
